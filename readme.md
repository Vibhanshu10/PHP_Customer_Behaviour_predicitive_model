#JAYROLEX Final Project

This is the final project for i210.

Collaborators are Jay, Ross, and Alex.

###Project Description
This team project involves the design and development of a functional database-driven 
PHP Web application, similar to those e-commerce Web sites on the Internet. The 
application should be capable of performing the four basic database operations: create, 
retrieve, update, and delete. The data layer of the Web application will be implemented 
with a MySQL database. This project will demonstrate your ability of conveying a project 
from the idea phase to implementation, your skills working in a team, and your mastery 
of procedural programming with PHP and data integration with MySQL. This project 
makes up 30% of your grade in this class. 

###Team Composition
This is a team project. Each team may consist of two or three members. Each team may 
freely choose its members from the class.

###Web Site Content
You will need to choose a theme for your site. You need to extensively research the 
Internet or other media and decide what information to include on the Web 
site. Followings are several suggested themes that you may choose to use. You may 
certainly choose the theme of your own. Check out sample projects from previous 
semesters at http://www.indiana.edu/~i210/students/.

####Project Ideas

* Shopping site
* DVD and CDs rentals
* Online banking system
* Library lending system
* Music bands
* Sports teams

###Web Site Organization
* Name the home page file index.php.
* A common banner and logo should appear on every page. Link the logo to the home 
page index.php. Make your site look consistently.
* Build a clear and efficient navigation system for the site.
* Organize files in folders. For example, put all images in the Images folder.
* Make sure you do not use absolute file paths. 

###Minimum Requirements for Features
* Displaying inventory.
* Displaying details of a specific product/item.3
* Searching inventory.
* Adding a product into the shopping cart.
* Displaying shopping cart content.
* Login/logout. Two levels of authentication: user level and administrator level.
* At least one of these three: adding a new product into the database, updating 
details of an existing product in the database, deleting an existing product from the 
database.

###Minimum Technical Requirements
* The Web site must have at least ten Web pages.
* Use an external style sheet to format a common style for the site.
* Modularize your code with functions and file inclusion.
* The Web site must have one page that requires users to login.
* The Web site must integrate with a MySQL database.
* Use at least two of the following methods to manage state information: hidden 
fields, query strings, cookies, or sessions.
* Authentication and authorization.

###Documentation
A short explanatory document must accompany your Web site. The document must 
describe both the technical and non-technical aspects of your Web site. It must include 
a flow chart to clearly represent the structure of the site. Please refer to the 
documentation template for details.

###Presentation and Promotion
Each team will need to present and promote your Web site to the whole class. The
presentation should be between 10 to 15 minutes long and you will have 5 additional 
minutes for questions. Make PowerPoint slides, handouts if necessary. Think of yourself 
as a market person and think how you want to promote your site.
